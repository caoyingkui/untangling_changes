3a7294898e8b65703e039911b6b77653a13b19fe,,2,Added dom4j XPath test harness. Also patched the Dom4jNavigator so that getDocumentNode() works properly. Also upgraded the JUnit version to a recent version. Finally added new dom4j-core.jar which contains the new version of dom4j which uses jaxen for the XPath engine
37a8b0004ec46b0ba57519cd7cfba0916a2df285,,2,General house-cleaning. Migrated dom4j's XPath tests to a new structure for Jaxen to test Navigators.
b2b8c2ecda4202948cea5d327ad27068881bb609,,3,Removed the JaXPath class and the confusing jaSelect*() methods. Also renamed the org.jaxen.expr.XPath interface and its implementation to be XPathExpr to avoid confusion with the core XPath interface. Also improved the JavaDoc somewhat to describe what a 'context object' is in the evaluation API. Things are looking much cleaner now. All test cases work and samples compile - except that issue with EXML and text nodes.

0a2b57fc39fe62681847499a4ddb4214482557bd,jaxen-20,2,Adding test for Jaxen-20 and that dom4j navigator uses namespace nodes in scope rather than simply declared
d6b15cddab57801af937de331aab33365294b730,,2,"Adding XOM 1.1 news. Fixing URL to Jaxen chapter of processing XML with Java. Changing ""nightly build"" to latest beta of 1.1, since we're not doing nightly builds right now."
464f58137027eddac46569c3bb2abf0112e3a1b0,,3,Two changes: 1. Don't need to test for Number. Jaxen always uses Double. 2.Doubles are immutable so we don't need to keep creating new Double(Double.NaN) objects. We can reuse the static field. Plus indentation cleanup
e88dab46899d32e1fefb63db1d4bc4a61e7ef73d,,2,Adding test for Jaxen-118 and removing unimportant assertion that fails on Java 1.4
20e1b3f2c74b2912d23a67e96e8e5d24ec5bc4dd,"jaxen-195, jaxen-197",2,Adjusting tests to fit newly mocked out nitf.xml per jaxen-195 and jaxen-197
b801a235e5c8ec1704736e5f73086a07cee34fb3,,3,Patched project.xml so that it works with Maven b5; also added an autogenerated build.xml document so that Jaxen can be built using regular vanilla Ant. Finally removed the libraries in CVS as the Maven build no longer needs them and they'd clash with the Ant build.
